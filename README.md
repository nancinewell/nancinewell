## Hey there!

I'm Nanci Newell, a student at Brigham Young University- Idaho interested in web and software development. 

I'm currently earning a certificate in software development to fulfill my electives and finish my Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. On my journey, I have also earned certificates in Web Media, Web Frontend, Web Backend, Databases, and Graphic Design. 

I have experience in Javascript, Node JS, Express, C#, PHP, HTML, CSS, Java, and MySQL.  </br>
